• Developed a Flask-based chatbot API for real-time currency conversion.
• The API receives JSON data, fetches conversion rates using an external currency conversion service, and
returns the converted amount.
• Utilized Flask for the web framework and Requests for API calls, ensuring robust error handling and JSON
response formatting.
• Key features include robust error handling for invalid inputs, scalability for easy integration and future
enhancements, security measures for data protection, and an efficient, user-friendly design.
